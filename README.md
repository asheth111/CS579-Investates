# Setup

1. Install the Python/SciPy stack on your computer (if you haven't already) by follwing the instructions here: <http://continuum.io/downloads>. We'll be using Python 2.7, **not** Python 3. I recommend using Linux/Mac for this class, but Windows should work as well. 

2. Install Pip <http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html>. Pip allows you to install additional Python libraries.

3. Install ipython: `pip install ipython`
